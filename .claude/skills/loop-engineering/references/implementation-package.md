# Implementation Package

Apply this reference when constructing the task a delegated worker receives, and when reading back what it returns. [subagent-delegation.md](./subagent-delegation.md#the-self-contained-task) states why the task is self-contained and why artifact content it reads is untrusted data; this reference states the implementation package's own shape — its sections, its artifact manifest, and its fidelity classes — as one instance of that.

The package does not mean pasting the whole issue into the prompt out of caution when the worker already holds a channel to read it — only a required entry no worker channel reaches gets carried directly, and only at the fidelity the manifest already declares (see [Artifact Manifest and Fidelity](#artifact-manifest-and-fidelity)).

## Package Sections

Every delegated Phase 2 or Phase 4 task carries these sections. Omitting one silently shifts a decision to the worker that the worker is not allowed to make.

| Section                | Carries                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assignment             | that the worker owns implementation, verification, self-check, and local commits — and owns no product or delivery call |
| Execution identity     | tracking-issue locator, phase, attempt number, parent locator, completion channel                                       |
| Approved-plan identity | plan locator, plan revision, human-approval locator and time                                                            |
| Artifact manifest      | every required artifact, with the fidelity and channel fields below                                                     |
| Repository context     | repository, working directory, base revision, branch, and where to find scoped instruction files                        |
| Working-tree state     | expected branch and HEAD, existing commits, expected uncommitted changes, prior receipt, known background processes     |
| Scope                  | in-scope outcomes, acceptance criteria, non-goals, expected and protected surfaces                                      |
| Decision boundary      | what the worker may settle, and what it must escalate                                                                   |
| Writer ownership       | that the worker holds the only project-file writer lease                                                                |
| Verification           | which checks to run, and that commands come from repository documentation rather than invention                         |
| Commit requirements    | cohesive local commits, no amend, no squash, no push, no merge                                                          |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST state the decision boundary explicitly: the worker settles implementation detail already implied by the plan, repository-dictated naming, test fixtures, and mechanical corrections; it escalates product or UX behavior, scope and non-goal changes, privacy or security posture, platform support, persistence or migration decisions, acceptance-criteria changes, conflicting artifacts, and ambiguous review findings.
- MUST treat expected changed surfaces as guidance for anomaly detection rather than an inflexible allowlist, unless project policy says otherwise.
- MUST require the worker to confirm that the human approval follows the current plan revision, and to return `approval_invalidated` before editing when the plan moved after approval.

## Artifact Manifest and Fidelity

A worker that reads an artifact through a channel too weak for it gets something that _reads_ as complete. Fidelity is therefore declared by the main actor in advance, not discovered by the worker afterwards.

Every entry names its artifact kind, locator, revision, whether it is required, the states or frames to inspect, and two fields that decide how it may be read:

- **fidelity class** — `verbatim` when the exact text is what matters, `visual` when the artifact must be seen, `prose` when the meaning suffices
- **sanctioned read channel** — the channel or channels adequate to that class

**Guidelines:**

- MUST list the approved plan as the manifest's first entry with fidelity class `verbatim`; it is an entry like any other, not a special case outside the manifest.
- MUST list the tracking issue's thread as a required manifest entry beside the approved plan — the clarify-gate answers, the decisions, and the background the plan body does not restate — with its own declared fidelity class, so a comprehensive specification is a manifest obligation rather than the main actor's per-run discretion.
- MUST declare a fidelity class and a sanctioned read channel for every entry, and MUST NOT leave an applicable artifact out of the manifest silently.
- MUST treat as unavailable a `verbatim` entry no channel returns faithfully and a `visual` entry no tool renders as an image, and MUST NOT substitute a weaker channel for either — a channel that strips or paraphrases returns something indistinguishable from the whole; carrying the same content at the same fidelity through the main actor's own channel, per the rule below, is not such a substitution.
- MUST carry a required entry's content directly into the package, through the main actor's own byte-faithful channel, at its declared fidelity whenever no worker channel reaches it, and record that carriage as the entry's sanctioned channel: this is the same fidelity delivered by the party that can reach it, not a weaker channel standing in for a stronger one.
- MUST require the worker to read every required artifact before editing, use the named revision, and return `needs_context` before editing when a required artifact is unavailable, ambiguous, missing, inconsistent, or reachable only at a revision the manifest does not name.

## Completion and Escalation Receipt

The receipt is what the main actor checks repository state against. A receipt that omits a failure or a still-running process turns a recoverable state into a silent one.

A successful receipt names status, plan revision, artifacts actually read with their revisions, commits with hashes and summaries, changed files and reasons, verification commands and results, acceptance-criteria status and evidence, decisions still needed, residual risks, remaining background processes, and the final branch, HEAD, and working-tree cleanliness.

A non-success receipt adds the failure stage (before edit, after edit, verification, or commit), whether the cause is a clarification or an approved-plan change, partial commits, uncommitted changes, the failed command or tool, background processes, and whether the same worker can safely resume.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST require every receipt to report remaining background processes, so writer ownership is never reclaimed while an unaccounted process may still be writing.
- MUST require exact commands, results, failures, and skipped checks in the receipt rather than a claim that verification passed.
- MUST keep the package and receipt contracts as prose rather than requiring structured output, so a harness without schema support can still run the delegated path.
