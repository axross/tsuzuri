# Next.js App Development

Use this capability whenever you write or review a Next.js application built on the App Router. It owns **the framework's conventions**: where files live and what their names mean to the router, which code runs on the server and which ships to the browser, how data is fetched and cached, how a mutation is exposed and secured, how errors surface, and how the app is configured, instrumented, bundled, tested, and deployed.

It carries **both voices**. Every reference states the authoring rule — what to write — and, where the surface has a known failure mode, the review check: what to look for in a diff and how severe it is when found. A reviewer loads this one skill to know what to review on a Next.js change; there is no separate review skill to pair it with.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Baseline and Scope

**Next.js 16 is the baseline.** Every rule here is written against v16 semantics, verified against the [16.2.x App Router documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) on **2026-08-02**. No rule is qualified as holding only on 14 or 15 — where a v16 rule inverts an older one, the older behaviour appears solely in the arrival checklist in [version-and-tooling.md](./references/version-and-tooling.md).

**The App Router is the only router in scope.** The Pages Router — `pages/`, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, API Routes — is out of scope entirely: no rule, no migration path, no comparison.

**Experimental and canary APIs are taught, not hidden**, each marked with the flag it requires and the channel it ships on, so a reader can weigh the risk deliberately rather than discover it in production.

**No vendor SDK is named as required.** Integrations are named by role — your auth provider, your error tracker, your analytics tool, your CMS — and a managed platform and a self-hosted pipeline are treated as two adapters of one deployment contract. Where a rule needs a concrete example, it is an example, not a dependency.

## Boundaries

This skill stops where another capability owns the subject:

- **A component's own mechanics** — composition, props contracts, logic extraction, state placement, memoization, list virtualization — belong to a React component development capability. This skill governs only which side of the server/client boundary a component sits on and what that costs.
- **CSS, design tokens, themes, container queries, and stylesheet structure** belong to a React component styling capability.
- **Log levels, capture semantics, breadcrumbs, and PII boundaries** belong to a software instrumentation capability. This skill owns only the Next-specific wiring that hands those signals to it — `instrumentation.ts`, `onRequestError`, `instrumentation-client.ts`.
- **Assertion design, fixture quality, and coverage judgment** belong to unit-testing, end-to-end-testing, and quality-assurance capabilities. This skill owns only what is Next-specific about testing an App Router app.
- **The OWASP lens itself** — injection, SSRF, secret handling, access-control modelling — belongs to an application security capability. This skill applies it to Next's own surfaces: server functions, route handlers, the proxy, image remote patterns, and environment inlining.

**The host repository's existing convention wins.** Every rule states a default for a project that has not decided yet. Where the surrounding codebase has already answered a question — the source root, barrel files, filename suffixes, the import alias — match what is there rather than migrating the codebase toward this skill as a side effect of an unrelated change.

## Project Structure

See [project-structure.md](./references/project-structure.md) for:

- placing a source root and organizing domain directories beneath it, each with per-kind subdirectories
- keeping `app/` as thin route entrypoints that import from domain directories
- separating the `common/` and `core/` cross-cutting tiers, and when a module earns a place in `common/`
- choosing the import alias, and the kebab-case file naming default
- deciding whether barrel files belong in this repository
- which files stay at the repository root even when a source root exists
- restructuring an existing tree without a rewrite

## Route Files

See [route-files.md](./references/route-files.md) for:

- the special files the router recognizes, including the experimental global not-found
- the order they nest in, and what each one wraps
- dynamic, catch-all, and optional catch-all segments; route groups, private folders, parallel slots, and intercepting routes
- colocating non-route files inside `app/`, and segment naming
- the pairs that cannot share a directory, and the slot files a build now requires

## Route Modules

See [route-modules.md](./references/route-modules.md) for:

- the three checks every server function performs before it writes
- keeping the exposed function thin over a fenced module
- what a mutation may return, and where navigation calls belong relative to error handling

- cross-origin and replay protection on authenticated writes
- generating images from a handler

## Caching

See [caching.md](./references/caching.md) for:

- applying the caching directive at route, component, and function level
- declaring a cache lifetime explicitly instead of inheriting the default profile

- the error boundary files, their scope, and the one that replaces the root layout
- the not-found files, including the experimental global variant
- the navigation interrupts, and the canary auth interrupts behind their flag
- how an error bubbles, and where a `try`/`catch` belongs
- rethrowing framework control-flow errors that a `catch` would otherwise swallow
- why a not-found interrupt is not an error to report

## Metadata

See [metadata.md](./references/metadata.md) for:
