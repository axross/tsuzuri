# Wireframe Design

This skill equips you to produce a **low-fidelity wireframe** — a breadboard mockup of any client-app UI, mobile or web/desktop. Reach for it to sketch a screen, breadboard a flow in words, connect screens into a wireflow, compare layout options, or run the wireframe round of a design review. It owns a **project-agnostic** breadboard vocabulary: two device canvases (a mobile phone frame and a browser window), the breadboard primitives, the component library, the archetypes, the annotation and wireflow layer, and the options-comparison layout — regions, hierarchy, and flow, never brand color or final type.

**High-fidelity (real-token) mockups** — rendering a chosen design with real brand color, type, spacing, and density — are a separate activity this skill does not cover; if the project has a skill for high-fidelity or visual UI design, defer to it for that round. When this skill runs inside a broader design-review or delivery workflow, that workflow owns how option rounds, the recommended marker, and any recording are handled; the general page craft of the surrounding page (its own typography, palette, and spacing rhythm) follows your host's page-craft guidance, when it has any.

The kit is [wireframe-kit.html](./assets/wireframe-kit.html) — a self-contained, theme-aware page carrying the two device canvases, the breadboard component library, the archetypes, the breadboard/wireflow/annotation layer, and the options-comparison layout. Copy it to a scratch location, delete the parts you are not presenting, fill it for the screen(s) at hand, then render, export, or publish the result — and validate it with the bundled [check-wireframe.mjs](./scripts/check-wireframe.mjs) before presenting.

The normative rules below are grounded in the external field consensus distilled in this skill's **Research-Grounded Best Practices** references (the routing section at the end of this document) — 18 principles across five topic files, each expanded with reasoning, do/don't examples, and citations to reputable sources (Nielsen Norman Group, the Interaction Design Foundation, Smashing Magazine, Basecamp's _Shape Up_, platform design systems). The MUST/SHOULD rules in this document are authoritative.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Choosing the Artifact

Low fidelity is not one artifact — pick the cheapest one that answers the open question. Reach for the HTML kit only when the question is about a screen's regions and hierarchy; when the question is a flow's steps, breadboard it in words first, and when the 2D arrangement _is_ the question, a fat-marker sketch beats any tool.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q{What is the open question?}
    Q -->|Steps and sequence of a flow| BB["Breadboard in words<br/>places · affordances · connection lines"]
    Q -->|"2D arrangement itself<br/>(chart, canvas, map, drag-and-drop)"| FM["Fat-marker sketch<br/>strokes too thick to detail"]
    Q -->|Regions and hierarchy of a screen| WF["Clean grayscale wireframe<br/>the HTML kit"]
    Q -->|"How a multi-screen task connects,<br/>including error and edge paths"| WL["Wireflow<br/>wireframes joined by control-rooted arrows"]
    BB --> ANN
    WF --> ANN["Annotate intent as a<br/>reserved-color callout layer"]
    WL --> ANN
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST choose the artifact by the open question — breadboard flow-and-sequence questions in words, fat-marker sketch a 2D-arrangement question, wireframe a regions-and-hierarchy question, and wireflow a multi-screen task with branches — rather than reaching for the pixel kit by default.
- SHOULD escalate within low fidelity rather than jumping to real tokens: breadboard or sketch first, wireframe once the structure is settled, and keep every step in grayscale with placeholder labels.

## How to Use the Kit

The kit is a copy-and-fill starting point, not a library to import. Produce one page per wireframe you are presenting.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST start a wireframe from [wireframe-kit.html](./assets/wireframe-kit.html) rather than reinventing the format, so wireframes stay visually consistent across runs and authors.
- MUST copy the kit into a scratch location and build there, keeping the working file outside any source tree you would not want a throwaway mockup committed into.
- SHOULD NOT commit the kit-derived mockup or any render into a source repository; wireframes are disposable artifacts — attach them to the review or keep them in scratch, do not carry them in the codebase unless the human explicitly asks.
- MUST keep the produced page self-contained — no external fetches (no CDN fonts, scripts, or remote images); the kit uses system font stacks for exactly this reason.
- MUST fill every `<!-- FILL: ... -->` point with the wireframe's real content and remove leftover placeholder labels.
- SHOULD delete the components, states, canvases, and archetypes a wireframe does not use before presenting it, so it shows only the intended design.
- SHOULD follow your host's general page-craft guidance for the page that frames the mockups (its masthead, spacing, and type); this skill governs the mockup vocabulary, not the whole page.

## Validating the Output

The kit ships a dependency-light Node validator, [check-wireframe.mjs](./scripts/check-wireframe.mjs), that mechanically enforces two of the MUST rules a filled page must satisfy. Run `node scripts/check-wireframe.mjs <your-wireframe>.html` (it accepts multiple files) and fix any failure before presenting.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST run `check-wireframe.mjs` against the filled page and resolve every failure before presenting — it fails on any external resource fetch (a `src`/`srcset`, `<link href>`, `@import`, or CSS `url(...)` pointing at `http:`, `https:`, or a protocol-relative host), which breaks self-containment, and on any leftover `FILL:` marker or `lorem ipsum` placeholder text.
- MUST run it on your filled copy, not the un-filled kit: the kit deliberately carries `FILL:` markers and so is expected to fail until you have filled and pruned it.
- SHOULD treat the validator as a floor, not a ceiling — it cannot see hierarchy, grouping, or grayscale discipline, so still apply the research-grounded rules below.

## Device Canvases

The kit carries two canvases so the same breadboard vocabulary serves both major client-app form factors. Pick the one that matches the target app; a project may use one or both.

- **Mobile** — `.phone` > `.screen`: a phone device frame with a status bar, nav bar, and tab bar.
- **Web / desktop** — `.browser` (`.chrome`, `.win`): a browser/desktop window with a title bar and address pill, hosting web navigation (`.web-topnav` top bar, `.web-shell` sidebar layout, `.web-drawer` side drawer).

## Breadboard Primitives

A wireframe shows places, affordances, and flow — regions and their arrangement — not fonts, exact spacing, or final copy. The kit gives each primitive a class and a legend swatch so a reviewer can read the breadboard without a key.

| Primitive             | Class                                              | Reads as                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile canvas         | `.phone` > `.screen`                               | a mobile device screen                                              |
| Browser canvas        | `.browser` (`.chrome`, `.win`)                     | a web/desktop window                                                |
| Header / nav bar      | `.navbar` (`.back`, `.title`)                      | top navigation with optional back affordance                        |
| App mark / icon block | `.w-mark`                                          | logo or feature icon                                                |
| Heading / label       | `.w-h` (`.lg`)                                     | a solid grey bar — emphasis text                                    |
| Body text line        | `.w-t` (`.w80`/`.w60`/`.w40`)                      | a lighter grey bar — running text                                   |
| Input field           | `.field` > `.box` (`.filled`/`.focus`/`.invalid`)  | a dashed box — a text input                                         |
| Button                | `.btn` (`.primary`/`.ghost`/`.danger`/`.sm`/`.lg`) | a solid fill; `.primary` uses the accent                            |
| Error row             | `.err` (`.dot` + `.ln`)                            | danger-tinted inline error                                          |
| Tab bar               | `.tabbar` > `.tab` (`.active`)                     | mobile bottom tabs; active tab uses the accent                      |
| List / settings group | `.group` > `.rows` > `.row` (`.danger`)            | grouped rows; `.danger` for destructive                             |
| Modal sheet           | `.modal-scrim` + `.sheet` (`.grabber`)             | a mobile bottom sheet over a dimmed screen                          |
| Inline card           | `.inline-card`                                     | content embedded in a card on the primary surface                   |
| Top nav (web)         | `.web-topnav` (`.brand`, `.links`, `.actions`)     | a web top navigation bar                                            |
| Sidebar layout (web)  | `.web-shell` (`.side`, `.main`)                    | a web app shell with a sidebar                                      |
| Side drawer (web)     | `.web-drawer` + `.scrim`                           | a panel sliding in from the edge                                    |
| Breadboard (words)    | `.breadboard` (`.place`, `.afford`, `.conn`)       | places, affordances, and connection lines in text                   |
| Wireflow arrow        | `.flowarrow` (`.alt`)                              | a transition rooted on a control; `.alt` is dashed for an edge path |
| Annotation callout    | `.anno` (`.anno-mark`, `.anno-note`)               | a numbered intent note in the reserved annotation color             |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST keep the whole page at breadboard fidelity: greys, dashed inputs, solid buttons, danger tint — never brand color (beyond the single accent/danger cue the primitives carry), final typography, or final copy.
- MUST include the legend when the wireframe uses the primitives, so the breadboard is self-explaining without a key.
- MUST signal destructive affordances with the danger primitive **and** an icon or label shape, never color alone, matching common accessibility intent.
- MUST render every annotation in the reserved annotation color (the kit's `--anno`, a hue distinct from both the accent and the danger tint so a note is never misread as an active element or an error), and reserve that color exclusively for the annotation layer.
- SHOULD reach for a primitive directly when no archetype or component fits, rather than bending one out of shape.

## Component Library

The kit opens with the common UI components client apps share (the shadcn-UI / Material vocabulary), grouped and laid out in isolation — the parts an author assembles into a screen when no archetype fits. Groups: _Foundations_ (heading/label, body text, avatar + stack, badge, divider, skeleton, mobile + web canvas); _Inputs & controls_ (text input, textarea, select — web and native-mobile variants, checkbox, radio group, switch, slider, date picker); _Buttons & menus_ (button, button group, dropdown menu, tooltip, progress); _Containers & navigation_ (card, sectioned navigation — grouped settings rows, tabs, pagination, carousel, empty state, message bubbles); _Data_ (table / data table); _Feedback_ (banner/alert incl. destructive, toast/sonner); _Navigation & overlays — mobile + web_ rendered inside device/browser frames (dialog, alert dialog, bottom sheet/drawer, bottom tabs; top nav bar, sidebar layout, side drawer for web). Each specimen is a `.wc-*`/`.web-*` breadboard part or a reuse of an existing primitive.

**Guidelines:**

- SHOULD assemble a novel screen from the library's components when no archetype fits, rather than bending an archetype out of shape.
- SHOULD show a component's relevant **states and variant axes** when they clarify the design — states (default, filled, focus, invalid/error, selected/checked, disabled), and where they apply importance (primary/secondary/tertiary), tone (neutral/accent/destructive), size (sm/md/lg), and loading. The library carries these as labeled rows, greys plus the single accent cue for selected/active/primary and the danger tint for invalid/destructive.
- MAY reach for a primitive directly when no component fits; MUST NOT let the catalog flatten genuinely different screens into the same shape (templated sameness).
- SHOULD delete the components and states a wireframe does not use before presenting it.

## Breadboards, Wireflows, and Annotations

Beyond single screens, the kit carries the three artifacts that answer flow-and-intent questions: a **breadboard** (places, affordances, and connection lines in words, for when the layout is not yet the question), a **wireflow** (wireframes joined by arrows rooted on the exact control that drives each transition, with a dashed variant for alternative and edge paths), and an **annotation** layer (numbered callouts in the reserved annotation color that carry intent the grey boxes cannot).

**Guidelines:**

- SHOULD breadboard a flow in words before wireframing it when the open question is topology and sequence, tracing every affordance to a landing place so a dead end shows up before any layout exists.
- MUST root every wireflow transition on the specific control that triggers it and draw the alternative branch for each decision point — invalid input, empty results, failure, permission denial, and Back — not only the success path, using the dashed `.alt` arrow for those edge paths.
- MUST restrict annotations to what raises questions — dynamic or conditional content, business logic, non-standard patterns, edge and empty states, accessibility behavior, and each primary action's outcome — and keep each note to a scannable phrase, never annotating what a competent reader infers on sight.

## Archetypes

The kit ships assembled breadboards for common screens in **both canvases** — mobile (empty state, form with error, settings/list group, tab-bar states, modal sheet, inline card) and web/desktop (app shell with nav + sidebar, form page, table/list page, modal dialog). They are **optional starting points**, present to speed authoring, not a required catalog.

**Guidelines:**

- MAY start from an archetype and adapt it; MUST NOT let the catalog flatten genuinely different screens into the same shape.
- MUST delete archetypes the wireframe does not use before presenting it.
- SHOULD add a one-line caption under each screen naming its regions, as the kit does, so the intent survives at breadboard fidelity.
- SHOULD note per screen how its layout adapts across device sizes (small phones, large phones, tablets, desktop widths) when it materially differs, using content-derived breakpoints (see the responsive-and-platform reference).

## Options-Comparison Layout

When a wireframe is presented as a set of options to choose between, the comparison must let the reviewer weigh candidates side by side. The kit's `.grid-options` renders each option as a `.card` with a label, a mockup (in either canvas), a rationale, and its trade-offs; the recommended option gets `.card.rec` and a `.badge`.

**Guidelines:**

- SHOULD present at least three options, each differing on a structural axis — hierarchy, layout, or visual treatment — not merely decoration.
- SHOULD give every option a sketch, a rationale, and its trade-offs, and mark exactly one recommended.
- SHOULD make every non-recommended option a genuinely implementable alternative, never a straw-man that exists only to lose.
- SHOULD render screens shared across all options once, above the option grid, rather than repeating them in each card.
- SHOULD follow the host workflow's conventions for how the options round is recorded and how the recommended option is marked, when this skill runs inside a broader design-review or delivery workflow.

## Research-Grounded Best Practices

These references distill the external field consensus behind this skill's rules, one topic per file, each with expanded guidance, do/don't examples, and citations. The MUST/SHOULD rules elsewhere in this document remain authoritative.

See [fidelity-and-intent.md](./references/fidelity-and-intent.md) for:

- matching fidelity (interactivity, polish, scope, content) to the question you are answering
- keeping the aesthetic deliberately rough so reviewers critique structure, not pixels
- reaching 'rough but solved' and holding every screen at the same finish level

See [process-and-collaboration.md](./references/process-and-collaboration.md) for:

- testing rough versions before code and generating multiple alternatives before converging
- declaring what is out of scope and involving cross-functional collaborators early
- using progressive fidelity to manage stakeholder feedback and signal how settled the thinking is

See [structure-and-content.md](./references/structure-and-content.md) for:

- establishing information architecture and hierarchy first, and breadboarding flows with words
- grouping with spacing and common region before adding enclosures
- using real or realistic content instead of lorem ipsum

See [flow-and-annotation.md](./references/flow-and-annotation.md) for:

- designing connected flows rather than isolated screens
- annotating intent as distinct, non-UI callouts
- keeping a consistent, reusable visual shorthand across screens

See [responsive-and-platform.md](./references/responsive-and-platform.md) for:

- wireframing mobile-first at real device scale and thumb reach
- setting breakpoints from content and adapting navigation per platform

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [fidelity-and-intent.md](./references/fidelity-and-intent.md) before choosing how rough or finished a round should be, and before judging whether a set of screens is solved enough to put in front of a reviewer.
- MUST read [process-and-collaboration.md](./references/process-and-collaboration.md) before deciding how many alternatives to produce, what to declare out of scope, or when to put a round in front of collaborators or users.
- MUST read [structure-and-content.md](./references/structure-and-content.md) before laying out a screen's regions and hierarchy, before choosing spacing over an enclosure to group them, and before filling a placeholder with copy.
- MUST read [flow-and-annotation.md](./references/flow-and-annotation.md) before connecting screens into a flow, and before adding a callout that states intent rather than UI.
- MUST read [responsive-and-platform.md](./references/responsive-and-platform.md) before wireframing a second viewport width, setting a breakpoint, or adapting a navigation pattern to a platform.
