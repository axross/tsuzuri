# CSS Modules (web)

Apply this reference to a web component that already uses CSS Modules, and to a new web component when CSS Modules is the project's primary styling mechanism. The platform-neutral rules — composition, tokens, property order, adaptive behaviour — apply either way and are not restated here.

## The Module Skeleton

Every module has the same three-part frame: the cascade layer that fixes its precedence, the scope that stops its selectors reaching other components, and a zero-specificity scope root that a consumer's class can override with one class.

Both at-rules in that frame gate their own contents: a browser that does not parse `@layer` or `@scope` drops the whole block rather than the one rule it did not understand, and renders the component unstyled. That makes the skeleton an adoption decision taken once against the project's browser support matrix — see [feature-support.md](./feature-support.md) — rather than something guarded per use, and it makes the two of them the floor every other feature in the module is measured against.

**Example:**

```css
@layer components {
  @scope (.blogPostHeader) {
    :where(:scope) {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      row-gap: var(--space-16);
    }

    .title {
      color: var(--color-text-neutral-high);
      font-family: var(--text-title-family);
      font-size: var(--text-title-size);
    }
  }
}
```

```tsx
import css from "./blog-post-header.module.css";
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST place every component rule inside `@layer components`, and MUST NOT leave a rule outside a layer — an unlayered rule outranks every layered one regardless of specificity.
- MUST wrap a component's rules in `@scope (.<componentRoot>)` so its selectors cannot match another component's markup.
- MUST check `@layer` and `@scope` against the project's own browser support matrix before adopting this skeleton, and record the decision. No fallback can be written inside either block — a browser that drops the block never reaches anything in it — so a matrix that cannot accommodate them needs a different structure rather than a degraded version of this one.
- MUST declare the scope root through `:where(:scope)` rather than `:scope`. The bare form carries specificity, which defeats the consumer-override contract; a consumer's single class must be enough to win.
- MUST import the module under one consistent local name across the project (`css`), so a reader recognises a module reference at a glance.
- MUST NOT nest one `@scope` inside another.
- MAY declare several sibling `@scope` blocks in one module when the file exports more than one component — a loaded and a loading variant, or a component whose fallback renders a different root.
- MUST NOT write a descendant selector that pierces another component's scope; cross-component styling goes through a consumer class or a shared token.

## Keyframes

Keyframes are globally named even inside a module, so two components that both define `pulse` collide silently and the last one loaded wins.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST declare `@keyframes` inside the component's `@scope` block, alongside the rules that use them, so the definition travels with its only consumer.
- MUST prefix a keyframe name that could plausibly collide with a component-specific prefix.
- MUST NOT duplicate the same keyframes into a second module. Two copies drift — the usual symptom is one copy gaining a reduced-motion guard and the other not — so extract a shared component instead.

## Propagating Style Context

A custom property declared on an ancestor is readable by every descendant, including descendants inside other components' scopes. That makes it the sanctioned channel for a parent to influence a child's styling without selecting into it — and the only channel, since a descendant selector across scopes is prohibited.

Two uses are common: a **tier** the parent announces and children react to, and a **state or variant** value the component toggles so a child rule changes without the rule being rewritten.

**Example — toggling a scoped property rather than re-authoring the value:**

```css
.image {
  filter: saturate(var(--image-saturation)) brightness(var(--image-brightness));
  transition: filter var(--duration-md) var(--ease-standard);

  --image-saturation: 1.75;
  --image-brightness: 1;

  @container style(--color-scheme: dark) {
    --image-saturation: 1.5;
    --image-brightness: 0.9;
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST declare a component-scoped custom property on the scope root when a value varies by context, and MUST resolve it either to a project token or to one of the literals the token-snapping rule permits — a ratio, a multiplier, or a fixed element dimension. A property that terminates in an off-scale colour, length, or duration is the leak the rule exists to prevent.
- MUST toggle the individual custom properties a composite value is built from, rather than re-authoring the whole composite per state; re-authoring detaches the state from every other branch that tunes the same value.
- MUST treat a custom property read across a component boundary as a contract: name it distinctly, and change it in both files together.
- SHOULD choose the propagation channel to match the axis — a style query on a custom property for a tier or scheme that many descendants read, a `data-*` attribute on the root for a discrete variant the component itself sets.

## Size-Based Styling with Container Queries

Container queries are how a component reacts to the space it was given. The tiering pattern, the choice between viewport and container units, and the breakpoint rules live in [fluid-and-responsive.md](./fluid-and-responsive.md); what follows is the CSS-Modules-specific mechanics.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST declare `container: <name> / inline-size` on the surface that owns a tier, and MUST name the container whenever a descendant needs to query a specific ancestor rather than the nearest one.
- MUST use container-relative units (`cqw`, `cqi`) for a size measured against that container, rather than a percentage that resolves against a different box than expected.
- MUST NOT declare a container on an element that also needs to be sized by its own content in the same axis; establishing an inline-size container makes that axis independent of the content.

## Styling a Third-Party Component

A component library that manages its own DOM usually exposes state as `data-*` attributes and applies structural styles inline. Those attributes are its styling API — target them rather than trying to replicate the state in React.

**Example:**

```css
.popup {
  opacity: 1;
  transition: opacity var(--duration-sm) var(--ease-standard);

  &[data-starting-style],
  &[data-ending-style] {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST style a third-party component's states through the attributes it documents, rather than mirroring its state into a React prop and styling that.
- MUST NOT declare a property the library applies as an inline style; the declaration cannot win and its presence misleads the next reader into thinking it does.
- MAY use `!important` in exactly one case — beating an inline style a third-party component applies, where no other mechanism can — and MUST annotate that use with the reason and the specific inline style it overrides.
- MUST NOT use `!important` anywhere else, including to resolve an ordering problem between two of the project's own rules.

## Scroll-Driven Animation

A scroll-driven animation degrades to its resting state where it is unsupported, which is only acceptable if the resting state is the correct fallback — so the guard is required, and the resting state has to be authored deliberately.

The subtle failure is the timeline resolving to the wrong scroller: [`animation-timeline: scroll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/animation-timeline/scroll) resolves to the nearest _scrollable_ ancestor, so an animation on a non-scrolling wrapper silently falls through to the viewport. Naming the timeline on the real scroll container and exposing it with `timeline-scope` fixes it.

**Example:**

```css
.scrollArea {
  scroll-timeline: --table-scroll inline;
}

.wrapper {
  timeline-scope: --table-scroll;
}

@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {
  .wrapper::before {
    animation: fade-in 1ms linear both;
    animation-timeline: --table-scroll;
    animation-range: 0 var(--space-32);
  }
}
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST wrap any use of a scroll timeline in `@supports (animation-timeline: scroll())`, and MUST author the un-animated resting state so it is a correct fallback rather than an accident. What earns the guard is the feature's interoperability against the project's support matrix, not the property being unfamiliar — see [feature-support.md](./feature-support.md), and re-check that interoperability rather than assuming the premise behind this rule still holds.
- MUST use a named `scroll-timeline` plus `timeline-scope` when the animated element is an ancestor of the scroll container rather than inside it; the anonymous form resolves to the wrong scroller.
- MUST confirm the element consuming a timeline is structurally related to the intended scroll container before using the anonymous form. A silent fall-through to the viewport is the failure this rule prevents.
- SHOULD name a timeline with a component-specific prefix so a second component adopting the pattern cannot collide.

## Modern Properties and Units

Each property below removes a value the stylesheet would otherwise keep in sync by hand — a colour duplicated from the text it should track, a physical inset mirrored for right-to-left, a viewport height that is wrong the moment a mobile toolbar moves. That is what makes them worth reaching for, and also why the ones that change layout rather than polish still need a usable state authored underneath them.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST write direction-agnostic properties throughout (see the writing-direction rules in [adaptive-styling.md](./adaptive-styling.md)).
- MUST use `currentColor` for SVG strokes and fills that should track surrounding text colour.
- SHOULD prefer `stretch` to `100%` for filling a parent axis, and the dynamic viewport units (`dvh`, `dvi`, `svh`) to `vh` for viewport-relative sizing.
- MAY use line- and character-relative units where they express the intent directly — `1lh` for vertical rhythm that tracks the current line box, `1ch` for a monospace column width.
- MUST guard a property whose absence changes layout rather than polish with `@supports` once the project's support matrix calls for a guard at all, and MUST author the unguarded state as a usable fallback. Interoperability decides whether to guard and consequence decides what the fallback must do; [feature-support.md](./feature-support.md) owns the pair.
