description: Writing, reviewing, or refactoring the styles of a React component on web or mobile native — the implementation mechanics of tokens, responsiveness, adaptive states, and platform stylesheets. Triggers on a CSS Module, a Unistyles `StyleSheet.create`, a theme or token file, global styles, "dark mode", "container query", "breakpoint", "responsive", "touch target", "hover on mobile", "safe area", "className", "colour gamut", "P3", "@supports", "Baseline", "reduced motion", or a surface wrong at some width, pointer type, or colour scheme. For design rationale — hierarchy, contrast targets, motion taste — use a high-fidelity UI design capability instead.

# React Component Styling

Use this capability whenever you write, review, or refactor the styles of a React component — a CSS Module, a Unistyles stylesheet, a theme file, or the global styles beneath them. It owns **implementation mechanics**: which properties belong to a component and which belong to its consumer, what shape the design tokens take and how they are consumed, how a surface adapts to viewport, container, pointer type, colour gamut and motion preference, and in what order the properties are written.

It does **not** own design rationale. Visual hierarchy, contrast targets, what a colour means, how much motion is tasteful, whether a state reads as interactive — those belong to a high-fidelity UI design capability. Where a rule here has a design counterpart, this skill states the mechanic and points at that capability rather than restating its reasoning.

This skill is self-contained and prescribes token **shapes**, never token **values**. The palette, the ramp, the type scale, and the spacing steps are the host project's; bind every value to the project's semantic tokens, and where a needed role is missing, add the token rather than inlining a literal.

**Platform adapters.** Two references are conditional, not universal:

- Apply the **CSS Modules** rules to a pre-existing component that already uses CSS Modules, and to a new component only when CSS Modules is the project's primary styling mechanism.
- Apply the **Unistyles** rules to a pre-existing component that already uses Unistyles, and to a new component only when Unistyles is the project's primary styling mechanism. Unistyles guidance here is scoped to mobile native.

Everything outside those two references is platform-neutral and applies either way.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Style Composition

See [style-composition.md](./references/style-composition.md) for:

- separating the properties a component owns from the ones its consumer owns, and the root-element properties a component never sets
- accepting and merging an incoming `className` or `style`, and the array-merge contract Unistyles requires
- deciding when a consumer overrides a child's styles rather than the child growing a prop
- pairing one style module per component, and sharing a component instead of sharing a stylesheet
- sizing a child from its parent, and the "appearance here, size there" split

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [style-composition.md](./references/style-composition.md) before adding a `className` or `style` prop to a component, before overriding a child's styles from its consumer, and before setting a property on a component's own root element.

## Design Tokens and Theming

See [theming.md](./references/theming.md) for:

- the token families a project declares, and the shape of each
- composite named text roles, and why family, size, leading, and weight travel together
- px-keyed spacing steps, the named radius and border-width tiers, and the hairline step
- duration and role-named easing tokens
- snapping a value to the nearest step, and the closed list of literals that stay legal
- reading a token outside a stylesheet — icon colour and size, navigator options, animated values

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [theming.md](./references/theming.md) before writing a literal value for colour, spacing, radius, border width, type, duration, or easing, before adding or renaming a token, and before reading a token outside a stylesheet.

## Colour and Gamut

See [color-and-gamut.md](./references/color-and-gamut.md) for:

- the 13-step ramp as an internal primitive tier, and the semantic role names components actually consume
- the step-to-role table, the colour schemes a project declares, and the alpha ramp
- picking a step by role rather than by how it looks in one scheme, and what a per-scheme override signals
- preferring a wide-gamut colour format, deciding whether it needs an sRGB fallback from the project's support matrix rather than from the format, and which of `@supports` and `@media (color-gamut:)` answers which question
- the colour-space reality on mobile native, and what it means for parity with web

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [color-and-gamut.md](./references/color-and-gamut.md) before picking a ramp step or semantic colour role, before adding a per-scheme override, and before authoring a colour outside the sRGB gamut.

## Fluid and Responsive Sizing

See [fluid-and-responsive.md](./references/fluid-and-responsive.md) for:

- fluid scalar tokens built with `clamp()`, and which tokens stay fixed
- choosing between viewport units and container units, and why root-level tokens force the viewport
- tiering a surface against its own container rather than the viewport, and propagating the tier to descendants
- declaring breakpoints, and what belongs at a breakpoint versus in proportional sizing
- measuring a parent on mobile native and feeding the measurement into a style

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [fluid-and-responsive.md](./references/fluid-and-responsive.md) before writing a `clamp()` or a viewport- or container-relative unit, before declaring a breakpoint or tiering a surface against its container, and before feeding a measured parent size into a style on mobile native.

## Adaptive Styling

See [adaptive-styling.md](./references/adaptive-styling.md) for:

- which conditions belong in a media query and which belong elsewhere
- honouring a reduced-motion preference on both platforms
- gating hover styles on the primary pointer, and why that gate differs from the one used for sizing
- sizing an interactive target from the pointer type, on both axes, and expanding a hit area without moving the visual
- print styles, and writing direction-agnostic styles for right-to-left layouts

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [adaptive-styling.md](./references/adaptive-styling.md) before adding a media query, a `:hover` or pointer-conditional rule, a reduced-motion branch, a print style, or a directional property that a right-to-left layout would mirror, and before sizing an interactive target or expanding its hit area.

## Feature Support and Fallbacks

See [feature-support.md](./references/feature-support.md) for:

- deciding a guard from the feature's interoperability across the project's own browser support matrix, rather than from its format or its age
- the reachability test that separates a live fallback from dead code, and the outward direction it runs in
- a block-gating feature such as `@scope` as a one-time adoption decision rather than a per-use guard
- `@supports` for what the browser understands against `@media` for what the environment has
- interoperability and consequence as the two axes a guard answers separately

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [feature-support.md](./references/feature-support.md) before authoring, keeping, or removing a fallback for a web platform feature, and before adopting one that gates its own block.

## Style Property Order

See [style-property-order.md](./references/style-property-order.md) for:

- the property group order inside a single style block
- where custom properties, nested at-rules, and pseudo-selector blocks sit
- the order of composed styles — base, variant, state, animated, consumer

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [style-property-order.md](./references/style-property-order.md) before writing or reviewing the order of declarations inside a style block, or the order of styles composed into one element.

## Global Styles

See [global-styles.md](./references/global-styles.md) for:

- what belongs in global styles and what does not
- weakening global styles so a component can override them without a specificity fight
- cascade-layer order on web
- the colour-scheme declaration, scrollbar, and selection styling
- the mobile-native equivalents of a global stylesheet

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [global-styles.md](./references/global-styles.md) before adding a rule to a global stylesheet, before declaring or reordering a cascade layer, and before setting the colour-scheme, scrollbar, or selection styling.

## CSS Modules (web)

See [css-modules.md](./references/css-modules.md) for:

- the module skeleton — cascade layer, scope, and the zero-specificity scope root
- keyframes placement and animation naming
- propagating style context to descendants through custom properties
- size-based styling with container queries and container-relative units
- styling a third-party component through its state attributes, and the one narrow case for `!important`
- scroll-driven animation, modern units, and logical properties

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [css-modules.md](./references/css-modules.md) before creating a `.module.css` file, before adding keyframes, a container query, or a custom property a descendant reads, and before reaching for `!important` or styling a third-party component through its state attributes.

## Unistyles (mobile native)

See [unistyles.md](./references/unistyles.md) for:

- the stylesheet signature, theme configuration, and adaptive themes
- safe-area-aware styling with the mini runtime
- choosing between variants and dynamic functions
- parent-size-aware styling from a measured layout
- reading the theme outside a stylesheet
- platform-forked style files, and the navigation-cloning caveat that silently drops styles

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read [unistyles.md](./references/unistyles.md) before writing a `StyleSheet.create` call, before choosing between a variant and a dynamic function, before styling around a safe area, and before forking a style file per platform or passing styles through a navigator.

## Verifying a Styling Change

A styling change is verified by looking at the surface under every condition the rules above make conditional — not by the type-checker, which sees none of them. Reviewing one rendering proves one branch. This section names the checks a styling change earns; how the result is then reported — which of them ran, which were skipped, and what risk a skip leaves — belongs to a **software development capability** under its verification topic, which owns it for every kind of change.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST check both colour schemes for any change that touches colour; a surface legible in one and not the other is a defect, not a polish item.
- MUST check both pointer classes for any change to an interactive surface — a coarse-pointer rendering for target size, a fine-pointer rendering for hover.
- MUST check the reduced-motion branch whenever an animation or transition is added or changed.
- MUST check the width range a fluid or container-tiered surface spans, at minimum the two ends and one point either side of each breakpoint.
- SHOULD check a wide-gamut display and an sRGB display when a colour is authored outside the sRGB gamut.
- SHOULD check a right-to-left rendering when a change adds directional properties.
