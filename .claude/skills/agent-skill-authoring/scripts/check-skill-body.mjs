/**
 * upstream-citation advisories for one document.

 * signal 1 fires once per uncited `Verified against` line, so a document

 * signal 1 found nothing. no document in this corpus repeats a `Verified
 * against` line today, which makes the two indistinguishable here — an
 * observation about this tree, not a cap the code enforces.
 *
 * two signals, in priority order:
 *
 *   1. a `Verified against …` line carrying no URL on the line itself. this
 *      one is exact, and needs no document-level context: the line asserts
 *      that something was checked at some point, the rule is that the URL
 *      rides the claim, and a citation three sections away does not discharge
 *      it.
 *   2. failing that, a document that pins a version anywhere in its prose while
 *      citing no documentation URL at all.
 *
 * the second is deliberately the weaker half of its rule. the MUST it proxies
 * turns on "pins a version or mirrors a vendor's option surface", and only the
 * first disjunct is mechanical — so a document that reproduces an option table
 * without naming a version stays silent here, and remains a reviewer's finding.
 * it is document-level rather than section-level because this corpus puts the
 * citation in a document's opening line, which a section-scoped check would read
 * as absent from every section below it. and it fires only at a count of zero,
 * so one URL anywhere silences it: at one citation the question stops being
 * "was anything checked?" and becomes "is this the right page?", which is
 * judgment.
 *
 * signal 1 suppresses signal 2 in the same document. both have the identical
 * remedy — add the URL — and reporting one missing citation twice would inflate
 * the count that scopes the cleanup.
 *
 * URLs are counted across the whole document, fenced blocks included, because a
 * link in a code sample still tells a reader where to look. version pins are
 * read from prose only, so a lockfile excerpt showing `"vitest": "^4.1.10"` is
 * not read as the document pinning Vitest. both choices push toward silence.
