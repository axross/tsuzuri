description: Building or reviewing a React component — how one is put together, from composition and props contracts through extracted logic, state, memoization, and testability, on web and mobile native alike. Triggers on "props", "spread props", "compound component", "variant prop", "empty state", "error state", "skeleton", "data-testid", "testID", "extract a hook", "useEffect", "where state lives", "memo", "virtualize", "FlatList", or a surface that re-renders or scrolls badly. For styling — CSS Modules, Unistyles, tokens — use a React component styling capability; for server state, a TanStack Query one.

# React Component Development

Use this capability whenever you write, review, or refactor a React component. It owns **how a component is built**: the files it occupies, the props contract it publishes, the logic it refuses to hold, where its state lives, what it re-renders, what it shows before its data arrives, how a test reaches into it, and when a list of them earns virtualization.

It does **not** own how a component looks. Design tokens, colour, typography, spacing, themes, container and media queries, adaptive rules, and the stylesheet's internal structure belong to a React component styling capability. The one place the two touch is the styling **prop** — a component's `className` or `style` is part of its props contract — so [styling-props.md](./references/styling-props.md) states that contract in full and marks itself as a deliberate twin of the styling capability's equivalent section.

Two further boundaries keep this skill portable:

- **Server-state libraries are out of scope.** How queries, mutations, cache keys, and invalidation are organized follows the host project's own server-state conventions, or a TanStack Query development capability where the project uses that library. This skill stops at the boundary: a component consumes server state, it does not fetch.
- **Framework specifics are out of scope.** React Server Components, `"use client"`, Suspense streaming, framework caching directives, navigator wiring, and native-module concerns follow the host project's own framework conventions; safe-area styling belongs to the styling capability above.
- **Semantics and keyboard behaviour are out of scope.** Which element carries which role, what an accessible name says, and how focus moves belong to a high-fidelity UI design capability. This skill states only what follows for a test hook (see [testability.md](./references/testability.md)).

**The host project's existing convention always wins.** Every rule here names a default for a project that has not decided yet. Where the surrounding codebase, its linter, or its formatter already answers a question — barrel files, export syntax, `readonly` style, the styling mechanism, the virtualization library — match what is there and do not migrate the codebase toward this skill as a side effect of an unrelated change.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Composition

See [composition.md](./references/composition.md) for:

- naming a component file and deciding when a component earns its own directory
- grouping sub-components with their parent by cohesion
- choosing named versus default exports, and whether to add a barrel file
- building a compound component from flat, name-prefixed parts wired through a private context
- separating primitive components from domain-specific ones, and promoting a repeated pattern
- accepting an icon as a prop rather than a glyph name

## Props Contract

See [props.md](./references/props.md) for:

- basing a props type on the rendered element and declaring an explicit return type
- destructuring props exactly one level deep and spreading the rest onto the root element
- ordering the spread so a consumer can still override what the component set
- naming handler props and their local handlers
- passing a whole model rather than flattened scalar fields
- expressing variants as closed string unions instead of boolean props
- supporting a controlled and an uncontrolled value from one component
- using `data-*` attributes as variant carriers, entity selectors, and third-party state hooks on web
- accepting and forwarding a ref

## Styling Props

See [styling-props.md](./references/styling-props.md) for:

- the contract every styled component owes its consumer: accept the styling prop, never drop it, merge it last
- composing class names on web, and which merge helper the host's styling mechanism implies
- merging styles on mobile native, and the array form a style runtime depends on
- deciding what a consumer may override versus what belongs behind a variant prop

## Logic Extraction

See [logic-extraction.md](./references/logic-extraction.md) for:

- keeping data fetching and persistence out of a component body
- reserving effects for synchronizing with something outside React, and what each misuse should have been instead
- choosing between a pure helper, a reusable hook, and a module-scope function
- leaving a single-use presentational sub-component unexported beside its only caller
- splitting a component across platform-forked files without duplicating its prop contract

## State Handling

See [state.md](./references/state.md) for:

- working down the state-placement table from local state outward
- keeping local state in the smallest component that owns it
- sharing state through context by default, and what a context provider should expose
- using the host project's store library when it has one, and exposing narrow selector hooks
- recognizing state that belongs to a server-state layer rather than to the component

## Memoization

See [memoization.md](./references/memoization.md) for:

- establishing whether the project auto-memoizes at build time before adding any by hand
- the narrow set of cases where `memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` pay for themselves
- why an unstable callback or object identity defeats a memoized child
- keeping a dependency list complete, and why an incomplete one returns stale values
- the nested-component-definition mistake that remounts a subtree regardless of memoization

## Loading, Empty, and Error Surfaces

See [component-states.md](./references/component-states.md) for:

- factoring the shared shape behind empty, error, and placeholder screens into one surface component
- wrapping that surface per feature so each keeps its own action control
- mapping a failure to user-facing copy outside the component body
- selecting among loading, error, empty, and loaded branches in one readable place

## Testable Components

See [testability.md](./references/testability.md) for:

- placing a stable test hook on every element a test needs to reach
- naming hooks scope-relative by default, and when a flat runner forces globally unique ones
- giving each state branch its own hook so loading, error, empty, and loaded are separately assertable
- propagating a caller-supplied hook through the props spread, including to a loading fallback
- choosing the mocking seam so the component's real logic still runs under test
- letting accessibility props serve as locators where no test hook fits

## List Virtualization

See [virtualization.md](./references/virtualization.md) for:

- the item count at which a web list earns virtualization, and why that call goes to the human
- choosing a web virtualization library, and preferring one the project already installs
- deciding between a scroll container, a flat list, and a sectioned list on mobile native
- never nesting a virtualized list inside another scrolling container of the same orientation
- shaping a list component so the wrapper owns the container and the row stays separately testable
- memoizing rows, separators, and headers, and supplying an explicit key extractor

## Verifying a Component Change

A component change is verified by rendering it, not by the type-checker — which sees none of the branches, platforms, or pass-throughs these rules turn on. This section names the checks a component change earns; how the result is then reported — which of them ran, which were skipped, and what risk a skip leaves — belongs to a **software development capability** under its verification topic, which owns it for every kind of change.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST render every branch the component declares — loading, error, empty, and loaded — rather than only the one the happy path produces.
- MUST exercise both platforms when the change touches a platform-forked file; a fork that compiles proves nothing about the sibling.
- MUST confirm a caller-supplied test hook and styling prop actually reach the rendered root, since a dropped rest object type-checks and fails silently.
- SHOULD render a list at a realistic item count when the change touches list rendering, not with three fixture rows.
